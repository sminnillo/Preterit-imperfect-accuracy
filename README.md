# Preterit-imperfect-accuracy
Data for a project focused on accuracy development in L2 Spanish preterit-imperfect marking

## Codebook

| Code  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Corpus  | The corpus from which the data was sourced.  |
| Text_ID  | The identifying key for each text analyzed.  |
| Participant_ID  | The identifying key for each participant. Note, this code was only used for the CEDEL2 data because every text in COWS-L2H came from a unique participant. Hence, the 'Text_ID' is equivalent to the 'Participant_ID' for the COWS-L2H data. |
| Course_Level  | The course in which the student was enrolled when they produced the text. Note, this code was only used for the COWS-L2H data because all of the students derived from the same university; the CEDEL2 students are from various different universities. |
| Proficiency  | The Spanish proficiency level of the participants.  |
| Modality  | Spoken or written- the modality in which the text was produced.  |
| Token  | The token (form) produced.  |
| Infinitive  | The infinitive of the token produced.  |
| Appropriate, Ambiguous, Inappropriate  | In these cells, we marked a '1' if the tense-aspect use in question met the classification of appropriate, inappropriatem or ambiguous (i.e., we were unable to determine its appropriateness).  |
| Form  | The tense-aspect classification of the token produced.  |
| Obligatory_form  | The tense-aspect classification of what should have been produced in that context (i.e., what is obligatory.  |
| Form_simplified  | Same as 'Form,' but with only 4 levels: preterit, imperfect, present, or other. |
| Obligatory_form_simplified  | Same as 'Obligatory_form,' but with only 4 levels: preterit, imperfect, present, or other.  |
| Frequency  | The log-transformed, summed token frequencies of all preterit and imperfect forms of each lemma. Frequency data was extracted from the EsPal corpus (Duchon et al., 2013).  |
| Regularity  | The morphological regularity of the verb in the preterit or imperfect, based on Camps (2005). |
